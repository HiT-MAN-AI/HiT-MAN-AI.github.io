    "report": "The meta-analysis titled \"Chest-compression-only versus standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a meta-analysis\" seeks to determine whether chest-compression-only CPR, performed by bystanders, leads to better survival outcomes compared to standard CPR, which includes both chest compressions and rescue breathing, in adults experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This study is divided into two parts: a primary analysis of randomized clinical trials and a secondary analysis of observational cohort studies.\n\nThe meta-analysis included studies that met specific criteria, focusing on adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received randomized instructions for either chest compression-only CPR or standard CPR. The primary analysis incorporated three randomized clinical trials, while the secondary analysis included observational cohort studies that met eligibility criteria, such as the availability of survival data and the inclusion of unstratified cohorts. A total of 1000 articles were screened, and 10 articles were selected for the meta-analysis, encompassing a total population of 4231 individuals.\n\nThe studies included in the analysis were diverse in design, ranging from randomized controlled trials to retrospective registry studies, and were published in reputable journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, which evaluates selection, comparability, and outcome/exposure. Most studies scored well in selection and outcome/exposure, indicating a generally high quality of evidence.\n\nThe primary analysis of randomized controlled trials revealed a summary ratio of 1.19 (95% CI: 0.93-1.52), suggesting a slight, non-significant trend towards improved survival with chest compression-only CPR. Notably, the study by Svensson et al. reported a ratio of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2-4.6), indicating a significant benefit of chest compression-only CPR in terms of 30-day survival.\n\nIn contrast, the secondary analysis of observational cohort studies yielded a summary ratio of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.35-0.46), suggesting that standard CPR may be more beneficial in observational settings. This discrepancy highlights the potential influence of study design and population characteristics on the outcomes.\n\nThe analysis of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in chest compression-only CPR showed a summary ratio of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33-0.44), indicating that chest compression-only CPR may be less effective in achieving ROSC compared to standard CPR.\n\nOverall, the meta-analysis suggests that while chest compression-only CPR may offer some advantages in specific randomized settings, standard CPR remains crucial in observational contexts, particularly for achieving ROSC. The findings underscore the importance of considering study design and population characteristics when interpreting CPR outcomes. Future research should focus on identifying specific scenarios where chest compression-only CPR may be most beneficial and exploring strategies to optimize CPR techniques for improved survival outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\nThis publication provides a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on CPR techniques, highlighting areas of uncertainty and suggesting avenues for further research. It is a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and researchers interested in optimizing CPR strategies to improve patient outcomes."
