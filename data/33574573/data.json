    "title": "Smartphone apps for depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of techniques to increase engagement.",
    "abstract": "Meta-analyses have shown that digital mental health apps can be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, real-world usage of apps is typically not sustained over time, and no studies systematically examine which features increase sustained engagement with apps or the relationship between engagement features and clinical efficacy. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify empirical studies that (1) investigate standalone apps for depression and/or anxiety in symptomatic participants and (2) report at least one measure of engagement. Features intended to increase engagement were categorized using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and principles of behavioral economics. Twenty-five studies with 4159 participants were included in the analysis. PSD features were commonly used, whereas behavioral economics techniques were not. Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g\u2009=\u20090.2888, SE\u2009=\u20090.0999, z(15)\u2009=\u20092.89, p\u2009=\u20090.0119, Q(df\u2009=\u200914) = 41.93, p\u2009<\u20090.0001, I\n",
    "question": "What features of smartphone apps for depression and anxiety are associated with increased sustained engagement and improved clinical efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety?",
    "criteria": "Titles and abstracts were evaluated against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies that were deemed potentially relevant were next evaluated by their full text. Reasons for exclusion were recorded. When more than one publication of a study was found, the study with the most information was used for data analysis.",
