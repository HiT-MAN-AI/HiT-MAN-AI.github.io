    "title": "Fertility\u2010sparing treatment for atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer",
    "abstract": "Background Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, and the fourth most common in high\u2010income countries, where its incidence is increasing. Atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) is an overgrowth of the womb lining and can be a precursor of endometrial cancer. Between 14% and 25% of cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed in premenopausal women. Due to delays in childbearing age and increasing obesity rates, a growing number of women wish to explore fertility\u2010sparing management of endometrial cancer or AEH. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of fertility\u2010sparing treatments, including pharmacological interventions (e.g. oral progestin, levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS), metformin) and bariatric or hysteroscopic surgery, for AEH and presumed stage IA grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases to 3 February 2025: CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; and Ovid Embase. We also searched five trials registers and conference proceedings and abstracts. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared fertility\u2010sparing therapy for presumed stage IA grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer or AEH with oral progestin compared to levonorgestrel IUS or metformin or other pharmacological interventions, or bariatric or hysteroscopic surgery (any comparison); or any of these interventions with the usual treatment (surgery). Other comparative non\u2010randomised studies were also eligible for inclusion (quasi\u2010randomised trials, non\u2010randomised studies (NRS), and prospective and retrospective cohort studies). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Where possible, we pooled data from RCTs in a meta\u2010analysis. Otherwise, we provided a narrative description of the results. Primary outcomes are overall survival and live birth rate. Secondary outcomes are progression\u2010free survival, complete pathological response rate (CR), severe adverse events, psychological symptoms, quality of life, pregnancy rate, and surgery for persistent/progressive disease. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We assessed the risk of bias only in RCTs, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, RoB 1. Main results We included 12 studies with 904 participants; six RCTs and six NRSs. Four studies included women with AEH, two, women with endometrial cancer, and six, both AEH and endometrial cancer. We judged the studies at high risk of overall bias. We pooled two RCTs into one meta\u2010analysis and described the remaining comparisons narratively. None of the included studies provided evidence for overall survival, progression\u2010free survival or quality of life for any comparison. Metformin plus progestin compared with progestin Metformin plus progestin may have little to no effect on live birth rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 3.68); 2 RCTs, 72 women; low\u2010certainty evidence) but may slightly increase CR (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.19; P = 0.03; 2 RCTs; 141 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). No fatal adverse events were observed. Weight gain was the most frequent adverse event in one RCT, with 5/74 (6.8%) cases of grade 3\u20104 weight gain in the progestin group versus 2/76 (2.6%) in the metformin plus progestin group (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.95; 1 RCT; 150 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Metformin plus progestin may make little to no difference in the need for surgery for persistent/progressive disease (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.78; 2 RCTs; 166 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Levonorgestrel IUS compared to oral progestin Only one RCT evaluated live birth rate, showing little to no difference between levonorgestrel IUS and oral progestin (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.39; 1 RCT, 34 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Data from two RCTs showed no evidence of a difference in CR in women with AEH (data not pooled): RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.98 to 3.25; 89 women), and RR 1.24 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.78; 19 women), both low\u2010certainty evidence. One RCT found that levonorgestrel IUS may decrease severe adverse events (weight gain) slightly (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.84; 1 RCT, 118 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence on surgery for persistent/progressive disease information was incomplete. Oral progestin plus levonorgestrel IUS compared to oral progestin One RCT in endometrial cancer evaluated live birth rate, finding no difference between oral progestin plus levonorgestrel IUS and oral progestin alone (RR 1.40, 95% 0.46 to 4.24; 1 RCT, 33 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in women with AEH (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.82;1 RCT, 47 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Data from two RTCs showed no difference in CR in women with endometrial cancer (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.59; 1 RCT, 54 women) or with AEH (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.76; 1 RCT, 86 women low\u2010certainty). The only grade 3 adverse event was weight gain, with no difference between the groups for endometrial cancer (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.17 to 7.34; 1 RCT, 59 women; low\u2010certainty evidence) and AEH (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.20; 1 RCT, 112 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Surgery for persistent/progressive disease was also similar in the two treatment arms, both for women with endometrial cancer (RR 2.07, 95% CI 0.20 to 21.60; 1 RCT, 59 women; low\u2010certainty evidence) and with AEH (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.48; 1 RCT, 86 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions In light of the low certainty of the evidence, it is unclear which intervention and which route of administration or dose of progestins could be of benefit compared to others for fertility\u2010sparing management of endometrial cancer or AEH. The addition of metformin to progestins may increase complete response slightly. Levonorgestrel IUS may result in no difference in efficacy in complete response, compared to oral progestins, whilst it may reduce adverse events slightly. Therefore, levonorgestrel IUS may improve quality of life and compliance with treatment.",
